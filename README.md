Windows is Microsoft's flagship operating system (OS), the de facto standard for home and business computers.

The graphical user interface (GUI)-based OS was introduced in 1985 and has been released in many versions since then, as described below.

Microsoft got its start with the partnership of Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. Gates and Allen co-developed Xenix (a version of Unix) and also collaborated on a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800. The company was incorporated in 1981.

In addition to the Windows OS, Microsoft develops and sells gaming systems such as the new Xbox Series X and a line of PC, laptop and notebook devices, including the Surface Pro.
